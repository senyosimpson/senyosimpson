### Akwaaba! 👋🏾

I'm a software engineer interested in both building and operating software systems.
I'm passionate about the intersection of developer experience and developer productivity.
How do we build tools that vastly improve developer productivity? I'm nurturing a growing
interest in tech leadership. I love to enable others to do their best work 🌱

I'm based in the beautiful city of [Cape Town], South Africa 🇿🇦

### Writing ✍🏾

I write semiregularly on my blog, [Undefined Behaviour]. It's focused on my learnings throughout
my industry journey. It's likely to converge around distributed systems and Rust 🦀

### Newsletter 📝

I keep a [newsletter]. I provide no guarantee on frequency of updates or consistency of content.
It's mainly centered around software and startups. I hope you find something to enjoy in there 📢
