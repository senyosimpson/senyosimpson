### Akwaaba! 👋🏾

I'm a newly minted software engineer with a core focus on infrastructure. I'm
passionate about developer experience and productivity and I'm nurturing a growing
interest in tech leadership. I love to enable others to do their best work 🌱

I'm based in the beautiful city of [Cape Town], South Africa 🇿🇦

### Writing ✍🏾

I write semiregularly on my blog, [Bloom]. It's focused on my learnings throughout
my industry journey. It's likely to converge around distributed systems and Rust 🦀

### Newsletter 📝

I keep a [newsletter], also named Bloom, go figure. I provide no guarantee on frequency
of updates or consistency of content. It's mainly centered around software and startups.
I hope you find something to enjoy in there 📢
